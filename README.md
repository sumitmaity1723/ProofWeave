# ProofWeave

## 🏷️ Project Title
**ProofWeave: A Blockchain-Based Proof-of-Existence System**

---

## 📖 Project Description
ProofWeave is a decentralized platform that allows users to register and verify digital document proofs on the blockchain.  
By storing document hashes immutably, it ensures authenticity and prevents tampering, providing a secure layer of trust for digital assets.

---

## 🌐 Project Vision
The vision of ProofWeave is to create a **trustless and transparent** verification ecosystem where individuals and organizations can securely validate the authenticity of digital files — without depending on centralized authorities.

---

## ⚙️ Key Features
- **Document Hash Registration**: Register SHA-256 hashes of documents on-chain.
- **Instant Verification**: Verify existence, owner, and timestamp of any registered proof.
- **Tamper-Proof Storage**: Immutable proof records stored permanently on the blockchain.
- **Event Emission**: Emits an event for every new proof registration for traceability.

---

## 🚀 Future Scope
- Integration with IPFS for off-chain document storage.
- Support for digital signatures and multi-user verification.
- Web3 interface for user-friendly proof submission.
- NFT-based ownership certificates for registered proofs.
- Cross-chain proof verification system.
